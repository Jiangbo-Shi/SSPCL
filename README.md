# Gastric Cancer Semantic Segmentation (GCSS) dataset
Download link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1EEmuDCQez1odggab3lElFQ; Extraction code: GCSS
Annotation: The annotation of each ROI is a pixel matrix with {-1,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which represents others, tumor, lymphoid stroma, desmoplastic stroma, smooth muscle, necrosis, and others, respectively.
Data statistics: 100 ROIs cropped from the 100 gastric cancer cases of the TCGA-STAD project.
